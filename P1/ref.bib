abstract = "Discovering hot topics within social network like Twitter and Weibo, has received much attention in recent years. While topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been successfully applied in topic discovery, they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content which is known as “posts”. In this paper, we propose a time-series based aggregation scheme for topic modeling in Weibo. As Weibo topics are coherent within a time slice, we divide Weibo dataset into groups by time slice. With this scheme, posts in every group are aggregated into several longer pseudo-documents using paragraph-vector based similarity algorithms. While applying this scheme to LDA model, we dramatically decrease the topic model perplexity and increase the clustering quality, which also allows for better discovery of underlying topics in Weibo. Furthermore, we can let other topic models extended on LDA be directly used on such short texts."

abstract="Microblogging is a recent social phenomenon of Web2.0 technology, having applications in many domains. It is another form of social media, recognized as Real-Time Web Publishing, which has won an impressive audience acceptance and surprisingly changed online expression and interaction for millions of users.It is observed that clustering by topic can be very helpful for the quick retrieval of desired information. We propose a novel topic detection technique that permits to retrieve in real-time the most emergent topics expressed by the community. Traditional text mining techniques have no special considerations for short and sparse microblog data. Keeping in view these special characteristics of data, we adopt Single-pass Clustering technique by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Model in place of traditional VSM model, to extract the hidden microblog topics information. Experiments on actual dataset results showed that the proposed method decreased the probabilities of miss and false alarm, as well as reduced the normalized detection cost.",
